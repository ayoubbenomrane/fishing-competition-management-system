## A comprehensive application for managing a fishing competition.
This system allows organizers to track player performance dynamically by recording the number of fish caught, total weight, and ranking for each participant across multiple competition days. Features include dynamic front-end updates, backend integration with Node.js and Express, and robust data management using a combination of raw SQL and Sequelize.
